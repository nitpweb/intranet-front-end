                  It is my pleasure to introduce one of the oldest Technological
                  Institutes of North India National Institute of Technology
                  Patna whose history goes back to 1876 when four survey schools
                  were established in Dacca, Hoogly, Cuttack and Patna. The
                  schools at Hoogly and Cuttack failed but those at Dacca and
                  Patna continued to prosper. In 1882, a separate altogether,
                  named as Bihar Industrial School, was opened in the premises
                  of the survey school in Patna college campus. In July 1886,
                  these two separate institutions were merged and given the name
                  of Bihar School of Engineering under the leadership of Mr. A
                  Ewbank, the then principal of Patna College. Between 1892 and
                  1902, a functional building which is at present the main
                  administrative building of NIT Patna, was built with Rs.
                  100,000/- donation from Nawab Lulf Ali Khan of Patna City. The
                  balance amount of Rs. 38,000/- came from the Prince of Wales
                  reception fund.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Prof. C. R. Walford was the Principal of this college from
                  1900 to 1926. In 1924, the engineering school upgraded to
                  Bihar College of Engineering under Patna University. In 2004,
                  MHRD, Government of India upgraded Bihar College of
                  Engineering to National Institute of Technology Patna and in
                  2007 it came under the act ‘NIT Act 2007’and declared
                  Institute of National Importance. At present NIT Patna is
                  offering undergraduate programs (B. Tech & B. Arch) and Post
                  graduate program (M. Tech & MRUP) along with Ph. D Programs.
                  Total number of students are nearly 3000. The institute has
                  state-of-art laboratories, in each department. This great
                  institute has produced large number of alumni who served the

                  Sinha, Chairman Atomic Energy Commission of India, Mr. C.
